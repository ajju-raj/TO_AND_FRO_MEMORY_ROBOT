## Features

- CAD model designed in SolidWorks.
- Two control methods: webserver-based and app-based.
- Detailed circuit diagram and fabricated PCB design.
- Demonstration videos.

## Demo Videos

Demonstration videos are available in the `GROUP_30_PS_6.ZIP` folder or [download here]([path/to/videos.zip](https://github.com/ajju-raj/TO_AND_FRO_MEMORY_ROBOT/raw/main/Group_30_PS_6.zip)).
